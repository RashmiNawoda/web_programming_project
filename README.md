## **Functionality**

1. **Car Price Filter**: Users can select a price range.
2. **AJAX-Based Dynamic Listing**:
   - Cars are dynamically fetched and displayed **without refreshing the page** using AJAX.
   - The filtering process is handled by **`fetch_cars.php`** which returns JSON data.
3. **Traditional Listing**:
   - If JavaScript isn't used, cars are displayed on **`car_listing.php`** using PHP and MySQL queries.

## **Database Information**

- **Database Name**: `car_listings`
- **Table Name**: `cars`
- **Table Structure**:
  - `id` (INT, Auto Increment, Primary Key)
  - `name` (VARCHAR)
  - `model` (VARCHAR)
  - `price` (DECIMAL)
  - `description` (TEXT)

## **How It Works**

1. **User selects a price range** in `car_listing.php`.
2. **AJAX sends the request** to `fetch_cars.php` without reloading the page.
3. **`fetch_cars.php` returns JSON data**, and JavaScript updates the car listings dynamically.
4. **If AJAX is not supported**, `car_listing.php` falls back to the traditional PHP-based filtering.
